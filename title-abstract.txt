Title:
DANE: Data Automation and Network Emulation Tool

Abstract:
In the field of network traffic research, datasets are often manually generated with in-house methods using fast internet connections. This creates a data representation issue, as we canâ€™t expect all internet users to have great network conditions. How can we make sure network research is taking diverse network conditions into account? Is there a better way to generate traffic datasets with representative network conditions?

DANE is a hackable and automated dataset generation tool which collects traffic data in a variety of configurable network environments. In our talk we introduce the tool, the purpose it serves, and how it works. Finally, we dive into an example of real-world analysis using data collected by our tool.
